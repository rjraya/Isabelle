 The set of theories presented in this homework is a solution to the Be Original!
 exercise of the Semantics course in the modality:
 
 "Find interesting modifications of IMP material and prove interesting properties
 about them"

 We have chosen to formalize the Guarded Command language (GCL), as an example of 
 how non-determinism could affect the development of the IMP material. The final goal
 is to write and verify some algorithms and prove their correcteness with respect
 to the given semantics. 

 As a set of the most relevant references for this formalization were:
