 Non-matching rules

 If you apply some rule (e.g. with apply (rule \<dots>)) and it fails and 
 you don't understand why, there is a little trick to find out. If you 
 add a using [[unify_trace_failure]] before the apply, you get an error 
 message that indicates where exactly the unification failed.
